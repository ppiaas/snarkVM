#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
//! A crate for the Marlin preprocessing zkSNARK for R1CS.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! Currently, Marlin only supports R1CS instances where the number of inputs
//! is the same as the number of constraints (i.e., where the constraint
//! matrices are square). Furthermore, Marlin only supports instances where the
//! public inputs are of size one less than a power of 2 (i.e., 2^n - 1).
